# Features

* Simple, intuitive UI
* Two game modes:
* Campaign: Battle through 8 levels and try to gt a highscore
* Simulator: Test your skills by creating your own level
* Lots of different powerups and enemies
* Persistent local highscores

# Installation notes

Requires Python 3 and Pygame. Creates and edits a highscores file (asteroid-attack-program-highscores.p) in the same folder as asteroid_attack.py so keep it in it's own directory to prevent it from interfering with anything else.   

# Change log

* 09/12/2016 - Added simple ship appearance customisation options that work in both game modes. 
* 07/12/2016 - Added sound effects to indicate the player is coming to the end of a level. "Level complete" screens are again being correctly displayed after each level.
