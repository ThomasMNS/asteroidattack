# Features

* Simple, intuitive UI
* Two game modes:
* Campaign: Battle through 8 levels and try to gt a highscore
* Simulator: Test your skills by creating your own level
* Lots of different powerups and enemies
* Persistent local highscores

# Installation notes

Requires Python 3 and Pygame. Creates and edits a highscores file (asteroid-attack-program-highscores.p) in the same folder as asteroid_attack.py so keep it in it's own directory to prevent it from interfering with anything else.
